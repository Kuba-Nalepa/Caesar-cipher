# Caesar-cipher
### There is an array of chars: "AĄBCĆDEĘFGHIJKLŁMNŃOÓPQRSŚTUVWXYZŹŻ" - Only those chars are able to be written in your input (lowercase is allowed for sure)
### There are two buttons for increasing or decreasing offset in your array
For example: if you increase offset by 2, it means that  char A (in your written message) is now equal to B
### There is a toggle button for decrypt (encrypted message previously on your own)
